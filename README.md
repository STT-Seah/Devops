# Devops Project 2: CI/CD


## Welcome to Fintech Learners Pages For Non Tech


In today's fast-paced environment, it's absolutely essential that we can automate the testing and delivery of our code. That's where GitHub actions comes in. It's the built-in, see ICD tool for GitHub, if you're unfamiliar with what see ICD is it stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery. Essentially it allows us to automate the testing of our code to make sure it meets certain criteria after all the tests are passed. You can enable actions to automate the delivery of your boat. This can significantly reduce the time. Takes for you to deliver updates your application, which allows developers to focus more of their time on the code itself. In this video, I'm going to go over all the theory. You need to know to understand the GitHub action, workflow in the lab portion of this video will go over how to implement our own GitHub action and implements a letter that will run checks against our code, to make sure that it meets specific criteria. So to start us off, let's go over the terminology, you need to know to understand a GitHub actions workflow file. So we We have a workflow llamo file which specifies events jobs. Runners steps and actions. So an event is a trigger for a workflow. A common event that occurs in a repository. It's when someone pushes new code, you can see that in this configuration file. We specify the workflow to trigger when someone pushes new code. When the event occurs, it's going to run all the jobs within the workflow in this workflow. We have a single job named. Super lint, that specify multiple steps.
