That's where GitHub actions comes in.

It's the built-in, CICD tool for GitHub, if you're unfamiliar with what CICD is it stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery.

This can significantly reduce the time it takes for you to deliver updates your application, which allows developers to focus more of their time on the code itself.
